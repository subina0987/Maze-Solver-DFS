Maze Solver using Depth-First Search (DFS)
📝 Project Description

This project demonstrates how the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm can be used to solve mazes. It includes a Python GUI that visualizes the step-by-step traversal of DFS as it explores paths and finds a valid route through a randomly generated maze.
